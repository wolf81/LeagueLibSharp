LeagueLibSharp
==============

A C# port of the Java project [LoLRTMPSClient][0] with some additional functionality. 

The eventual goal is to create a library that could be used to power a website like [LOLKING][1]. A lesser priority would be to get the library running on iOS / Android using Xamarin.

Be warned: the code is still very much a work-in-progress and contains much debugging shizzle. The idea is to get things working first and then clean up the code. Also: I haven't got much experience with low-level programming, so I'll leave the bit-shift / bit-masking code pretty much as-is for now, but hopefully I can improve upon it at a later time.
